# Age Estimation Using Transfer Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores **age estimation** using **transfer learning** with **NASNet** and **MobileNet v3 Small**. By leveraging pre-trained models, we fine-tune them on the **Appa-Real dataset** to predict both real and apparent ages from images. The goal is to develop an efficient and scalable age prediction system.

## 📂 Dataset
We use the **Appa-Real dataset**, which contains **7,591 images** labeled with real and apparent ages. The images are preprocessed and converted into **NPY format** for model training.

## ⚙️ Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Image normalization, resizing, and conversion to array format.
2. **Model Selection**: Experimenting with **NASNet** and **MobileNet v3 Small** for transfer learning.
3. **Fine-Tuning**: Adjusting hyperparameters and training strategies for improved predictions.
4. **Evaluation**: Comparing models with existing production-level approaches.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **TensorFlow / Keras**
- **OpenCV**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**
